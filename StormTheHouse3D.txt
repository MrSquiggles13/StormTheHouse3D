StormTheHouse3D

Map:

- Basic Landscape
- Less tiles textures
- Make Bodies of Water
- Foliage that doesnt kill my computer
- House model

|----------------

Menu:

- Main menu *play *settings *progress?/statistics *quit
- In game menu *settings *pause
- buy menu *tabs for different upgrades 

|------------------------

Player:
- watch tower/char model
- mouse cursor crosshair (fires from watchtower)
- free camera movement
- can select unit to use to fire with
- meelee spartan char ultimate that can charge out be used for a duration then is beamed up by aliens

|-----------------------

Weapons:
- attachments (scopes, grips etc)
- variable recoil and bullet spread

|-----------------------

Helpers:
- have own weapons and gear
- can be upgraded themselved or upgrade/trade out gear
- can be individually controlled

|-----------------------

Enemy:

- Stick figure models
- Basic animations
- Basic AI
- Different enemy types

|-------------------------

Notes:
when in free camera can shoot with watchtower main char only and select other characters, if highlighting something/someone

start with watchtower, character, wall, basic enemies, first person only, no animations, no upgrades, no menu *DONE*

bullet spread can be kind of like gravity where over time
the bullet spread is reduced to zero but increases up to a threshold 

player should have camera object since perspective is based on the player

world should handle instantiating helpers and placing objects into the world**DONE**

physics should be handled centrally by a physics handler**DONE**

entities (objects) should have an extendable class and be conherent with the physics handler*DONE*
entities should also be instantiated with position and velocity

Multiplayer: have someone on other side trying to send troops towards you while you defend and do the same
    - can equip minions and control them. When minions die they drop equipment (?maybe keep one or refund some etc)
    - other minions or player (friend or foe) can pick up the equipment

FINISHED:
    - watchtower: giant block *DONE*
    - player: basic capsule *DONE*
    - gun: skinny cylinder *DONE* **added animation
    - projectiles: tiny cylinder *DONE*
    - enemies: basic capsule *DONE* **added waves and attack on wall
    - landscape: flat rectangle *DONE*
    - wall: thick upright rectangle *DONE*
    - hit feedback: flashing when hit *DONE*
    - aiming: can zoom in to ADS with scope overlay *DONE*
    - skybox: added a, well, a skybox *DONE*
    - health bar: added health bars for enemies and wall *DONE*
    - UI: screen info for bullet capacity, money, and wall health *DONE*

    - weapons: create an impl weapon class and create multiple weapons *DONE*
    - ~BUG~ Impact decal interferes with hit markers for enemies *FIXED*
    - ~BUG~ Player's current weapon a part of collision mesh and interferes with movement and collisions *FIXED*
    - Github you bitch *DONE*

    - convert project to use Vite *DONE*
    - redo model creation in seperate editor instead of directly in three js (Blender?) **DONE** 
            ~Just the watchtower but functionality still the same~
    
    - ~BUG~ fix lighting: lighting is now dim after switching to vite, most likely threejs is using newer version**FIXED**

CURRENT:
    - migrate over to an ECS architecture
    - deprecate this repo and migrate to a new one to start with clean slate
   

UP NEXT:
    - refactor how physics bodies are made and handled + how the entity class is implemented
    - dont explicitly pass objects to other objects i.e. wall to enemy to see collision

    - physics handler: add gravity and restructure the collision detections
        - remove all old mechanics for physics**DONE**
        - incorporate a system to pass three meshs and make physics Bodies**DONE**
            - ~issue~ group mesh cannot orient the physics bodies in correct place without referencing the parent mesh**DONE**
        - create collision detection for unique functionalities i.e. enemies attack a wall
        - make kinematic bodied work with physics and controller (player or AI controlled)**DONE**

    - decouple: refactor files to be more modular coherent and consistent
        - scene only handled by World "Where am I putting you, How do I make you?" *DONE*
        - camera only handled by player "What am I looking at? How do I interact with the World?"
        - player controls characters isn't character themselves "Who am I controlling and what posessions do I have?"
        - static objects "Here is my structure and my position"
        - kinematic objects "Same as static yet here is how I move"

    - reload anims: add mag that falls out and new one inserted

    - clubs: short fat cylinder w/ animation for basic enemy
        - for meelee attack make a "window of collision" some kind of shape cast 
    - enemies: create impl class for enemies, equip weapons, have dynamic stats etc
    - add enemies: make some alternitive enemies, have a pool of atleast 3

    - house: giant block readjust wall and tower to compinsate for angles
    - structures & landscape: more dynamic ground and redo wall to have look throughs and better texture

    - menus: starting menu game over menu and a buy menu

    - weapons: RangedWeapon and MeeleeWeapon classes?
